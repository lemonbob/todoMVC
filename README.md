Optimization of todoMVC project with attention to DOM/render-tree optimization, and MVC architecture to ensure proper decoupling of Model View and Controller components.

**Performance increase of 20-50 fold over existing javascript code and 500 fold over frameworks** 

**Performance confirmed by Chrome Developer Tools and performanceNow() calculated methodologies.**

> this demonstrates how the changes done have drastically improved the performance. Ashutosh Purushottam (senior full-stack developer)

For performanceNow() testing method, see js/performacetimer.

To use performanceNow: function start(name of timer: string);
call get recorded time and output time to console: call stop();

Multiple simultaneous times are currently not possibe but can be added.
